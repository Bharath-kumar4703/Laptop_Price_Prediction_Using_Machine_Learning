# Laptop_Price_Prediction_Using_Machine_Learning
ðŸ’» Project Title: Laptop Price Prediction
Company: SmartTech Co.

Project Description:
Designed and implemented a machine learning model to accurately predict laptop prices based on key hardware and brand features. Utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Scikit-learn to perform comprehensive data analysis and model development. The project involved thorough data preprocessing including handling of null values, duplicates, and inconsistent entries to ensure clean and reliable data. Conducted exploratory data analysis (EDA) to uncover feature relationships, followed by feature engineering and encoding. Applied regression algorithms and performed hyperparameter tuning to enhance model performance.
The model identified significant features affecting laptop price such as CPU type, RAM, brand name, and screen resolution, providing SmartTech Co. with valuable insights for pricing strategy and product positioning.
